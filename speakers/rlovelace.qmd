Robin Lovelace is a University Academic Fellow at the **Leeds Institute for Transport Studies (ITS)**. 
He did his PhD in the Energy Costs of Commuting, leading to new methods for processing spatial and individual level 
data to generate scenarios of decarbonisation, leading to the open source books Spatial Microsimulation with R and, 
recently, Geocomputation with R. Robin has wide ranging experience modeling sustainable transport systems and visualizing 
transport futures. These skills have been applied on a number of projects with real-world applications, most recently as 
Lead Developer of the **Propensity to Cycle Tool** and the **stplanr package** for sustainable transport planning.
