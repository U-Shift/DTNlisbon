The DTN Annual Forum is the DTN’s annual flagship event that gathers experts, scholars, and industry leaders from around the world to discuss the latest advancements in urban mobility. This vibrant forum offers participants an opportunity to present their research, engage in insightful discussions, and foster collaborations.
