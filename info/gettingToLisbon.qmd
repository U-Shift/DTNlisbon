Lisbon has two main stations for long distance services. Despite not having direct connections with foreign countries, if you come from anywhere in Portugal you can get here by picking a train with destination **Lisboa Santa Apol√≥nia** if you come from the north or **Lisboa Oriente** if you come from the south. Both stations are connected to the metro network and urban railway services.
