## Tickets

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>{{< fa circle-info >}}</strong> Every participant will be provided with a 10€ Zapping card on the first day of the event.
</div>


Trips can be payed with **contactless** cards, being charged the same amount as for the board ticket. However, you can buy a **Zapping card** (0,50€ per card, one card per person) at the Metro machines and top it up with 3, 5 or 10€. Using this card, the individual trips are cheaper on buses and trams.

|  |  |  |
| -- | -- | -- |
| | Contactless/board ticket | Zapping | 
| Metro | 1,85€ | 1,66€ | 
| Bus | 2,20€ | 1,85 € |
| Tram | 3,20€ | 1,85 € | 
| Lifts | 4,20€ | 1,85€ |


As an alternative, you can buy a **24 hour card** (at the Metro machines) valid for the whole network (metro+bus+tram+lifts), for only 7,00€.
