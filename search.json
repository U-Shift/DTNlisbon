The Lisbon Cathedral is almost 9 centuries old, and from there you‚Äôre presented a choice - up the hill to Rua Augusto Rosa, or down the hill to Cruzes da S√©.\nUphill, climb up to the first viewpoint, Santa Luzia. If you‚Äôre already hungry, Alpendre is a great traditional restaurant on the way. If not, keep going until Portas do Sol, one of the most beautiful lookout points in the city. Stop awhile for a drink at The Terrace, climb a little further up to Rua das Escolas Gerais, and make your way to the Santo Estev√£o belvedere. There‚Äôs plenty of good restaurants around, but we‚Äôd suggest Lisboa Tu & Eu, A Morgadinha, Taberna Sal Grosso, and Sr.¬†Fado.\nDownhill, have a stroll down Rua Cruzes da S√©, through the Largo de S√£o Miguel, down to the Largo do Chafariz de Dentro. Have a ginginha (sour cherry liqueur) and refer to the restaurant suggestions we‚Äôve mentioned above."

Take the funicular up to the Miradouro Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen. Have a drink and a snack in one of the many caf√©s on the way to or on the main square (Largo da Gra√ßa) - we are partial to both Cabreira and Saga for some pastries and coffee. Then do climb further up to the Miradouro Senhora do Monte, Lisbon highest viewpoint, for a breathtaking sunset view.\n\n\n\nPhoto by TheDumpy on Wikimedia\n\n\nFor dinner, we recommend O Pit√©u da Gra√ßa, Via Gra√ßa, Sant‚ÄôAv√≥ and Taberna do Mar."

Take the first lift from Rua dos Fanqueiros to Largo Adelino Amaro da Costa and, if you‚Äôre already feeling peckish, treat yourself to one of the best sandwiches in town and have a bifana (pork sandwich) at Bifanas do Afonso. Then take the second lift inside Ch√£o de Loureiro and chill with a drink at the gorgeous viewpoint on top.\nCome down the street to S√£o Cristov√£o, and have a wander around the streets and alleys of Mouraria - we recommend taking the stairs toLargo da Achada, then coming down to Beco das Farinhas to take a look at Tribute, a permanent photography exhibit featuring the neighborhood‚Äôs oldest residents. Make your way to Largo dos Trigueiros, with two excellent choices for some dining - O Corvo, and Cantinho do Aziz (for some excellent samosas). We also thoroughly recommend O Velho Eurico and Tasca Baldracca, both serving new twists on traditional portuguese fare.\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Fabien Rousselot on Unsplash"
